## Running Instructions
- The Drive folder contains a HTML readme that contains links to the product and other documentation for the product
- You can either download the folder locally and open the HTML file which will direct you to further access the project

- Otherwise, you can see me explain the products working and demo in the "Documentation" Folder under "Criterion D.mp4"

- If you wish to run the file directly, you can find the executable jar file in the "Product" folder under "Main IA" under "dist" in the "MAIN_IA.jar" file

####The files in this github repository are the original source code files without the additonal required libraries, packages and .jar files used in the project etc. that could not be uploaded to GitHub
